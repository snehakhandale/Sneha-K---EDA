# Web Scraping IMDb Top 250 Movies and US States Population

## Overview
This project consists of Python scripts for web scraping data from IMDb's top 250 movies list and Wikipedia's list of US states and territories along with their populations. The scripts retrieve the relevant information from these websites and print it out for further use or analysis.

## Features
- **IMDb Top 250 Movies**: The `imdb_top_250_movies.py` script fetches the titles of the top 250 movies from IMDb.
- **US States Population**: The `us_states_population.py` script retrieves population data for US states and territories from Wikipedia.
- **Robust Handling**: Both scripts are designed to handle errors gracefully, ensuring smooth execution even in case of unexpected issues.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`

## Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas`.
3. Run the scripts (`imdb_top_250_movies.py` and `us_states_population.py`). They will fetch the data and print it out on the console.
